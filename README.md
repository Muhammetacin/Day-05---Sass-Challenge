# Day-05---Sass-Challenge

Home (or index) page shows the text in yellow color. By using only one css base (style.scss) I change the color of the text to red (red.html) and blue (blue.html).

- You create 2 html files, red.html and blue.html
- You create 2 scss files for these html files and link to red.css (generated from scss, watching = automatically generating them) and blue.css in html <head> part. 
- The code in these red.scss and blue.scss files can be found in Discord help channel. What you do is just import the style.scss file and then change the color of the body tag.

Don't forget to link correctly with the html/css files!
